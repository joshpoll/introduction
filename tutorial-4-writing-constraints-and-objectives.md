# Tutorial 4: Writing Constraints & Objectives

## Introduction

We've been using constraints and objectives in our previous tutorials, and now we will begin writing our own constraints and objectives! Being able to write your own constraints and objectives is an important step in becoming an advanced Penrose developer. 

We will start with understanding how are constraints and objectives done in Penrose, and then we will go through several examples line by line to apply our conceptual understanding concretely. 

## How 

1. constraints: minSize, maxSize of circles
2. constraints: circles contained in canvas rectangle
3. objective: two circles in a rectangle repel each other
