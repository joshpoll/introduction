# Tutorial 4: Writing Constraints & Objectives

## Introduction

We've been using constraints and objectives in our previous tutorials, and now we will begin writing our own constraints and objectives! Being able to write your own constraints and objectives is an important step in becoming an **advanced Penrose developer**. 

You can for sure create beautiful diagrams with what you have already learned from the previous tutorials as _an user of the Penrose system_, whereas with the knowledge from this tutorial, you will be _extending the existing Penrose system_, producing tools other people can use as well. Therefore, read on if you want to understand the system side inner-workings of Penrose. 

We will start with understanding what, and how are constraints and objectives done in Penrose, and then we will go through several examples line by line to apply our conceptual understanding concretely. 

## TO\_DO: What is optimization / energy function? What is a constraint? 

## Conceptual: How To Come Up With Constraints?

In the normal world, when we want a circle A contained in another circle B, this is normally what comes into our mind:

\[ insert circle containment \]

But let's pause for a second, and _really_ think about what does it meant for a circle to be contained in another circle mathematically? 

There are generally 3 scenarios for the containment relationship between 2 circles. 

\[ insert 3 scenarios \]

We have completely not contained, partially contained, and completely contained. It is visually obvious to any of us. We get showed 2 circles, and in a split second, we can identify their containment relationship. Unfortunately, Penrose does not have eyes,  but good news is, it speaks math! Therefore, let's take a new look at these circles.

\[ insert 3 scenarios with radius \]

Recall the general equation for a circle where \( h, k \) is the center and r is the radius. 

$$
(x - h )^2 + ( y - k )^2 = r^2
$$

The center coordinate and radius are the information we have about **any** circle, and we will use these information to determine two circle's containment relationship. We begin with getting the distance between the circles' centers. 

\[insert distance\]

Notice how the distance is progressively smaller as A is more and more contained in B as expected. So a potentially working but not very good energy function would be returning the distance between the centers. We will take a step further and subtract the difference between A and B's radii,  `B-A` from the distance `d`.

## Concrete: How We Write Constraints

With our Penrose triple, the syntax is most likely familiar to you from your prior programming experiences, but with constraints, we will be writing code in a particular way that allows Penrose to use a particular technique called **automatic differentiation,** _**autodiff**_ ****for short. The Penrose system uses autodiff to find the optimized diagram. Essentially, we need to write constraints and objectives in a specific way in order for Penrose to do its magic. For more on autodiff, read [here](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/wiki/Autodiff-guide#introduction). 

So now, how exactly do we write it? 

### 1. Autodiff functions

We enter this new world without our normal operations such as `+`  and `-`. Instead of what we normally can do across different languages such as javascript, python or c, we now have to use special number types and operations. 

But no worries, it's straightforward. We have unary, binary, trinary, n-ary, and composite operations. The list of autodiff functions can be found [here](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/wiki/Autodiff-guide#to-use-the-autodiff). For example, instead of `a + b`, we now do `add(a, b)`. 

### 2. Special Number Types

All numbers need to actually be special types called `VarAD`  to be valid inputs for the autodiff functions. We can convert to and from normal numbers and `VarAD` using the functions `varOf: number -> VarAD` and `constOf: number -> VarAD` , and `numOf: VarAD -> number`, where the type `number` is our common const number values like `1, 2, 3, ...`.

For example, if we need to do `5 + 3` , the equivalent autodiff expression is `add(constOf(5), constOf(3))` or `add(varOf(5), varOf(5))`. 

### 3. Write functional code

We must write these functions in _straight-line functional style_ \(i.e. no imperative style, no mutating state, no for-loops or if statements\). These restrictions are so the Penrose system can work its magic. Therefore we need to avoid writing things like `x = x + 1`  which translates to `let x = add(x, constOf(1))`  in autodiff code, and instead use constant intermediate variables like this: `const x0 = ... const x1 = add(x0, constOf(1))`. 

### 4. Zero-based inequality to penalty 

For every constraint function we write, we take in shapes and output a number or a tensor as penalty. In short, Penrose will try to minimize the outputs of all the constraint functions used for the diagram. 

When we write a constraint, for example, we want to constrain one circle `s1` to be smaller than another circle `s2` by some amount `offset`. In math, we would require that `r1 - r2 > offset`. An inequality constraint needs to be written in the form `p(x) > 0`.  

Since we penalize the amount the constraint is greater than `0`. So, this constraint is written as `r1 - r2 - offset > 0`, or `p(r1, r2) = r1 - r2 - offset`. 

#### Some general rules on writing penalty: 

* Let's say I want the constraint `f(x) <= c` to be true.
* I translate it to the zero-based inequality `f(x) - c <= 0`.
* I translate the inequality constraint into an energy \(penalty\) `E(x) = f(x) - c` â€” it is greater than `0` iff the constraint is violated, and the more the constraint is violated, the higher the energy is \(e.g. if `f(x)` is way bigger than `c` then the energy is a lot bigger than `0`\). 

### 5. Accessing Shape Field Value

 One common operation is to access the parameter of the shape, which is done via `shapeName.propertyName.contents`, which will return a `VarAD`.  For example, if you had a circle `c` as input, and you want its radius, doing `c.r.contents` will give you something like `5.0` \(wrapped in a `VarAD`\).

## Constraints Example: minSize & maxSize

We will go through examples of `minSize` and `maxSize` constraints that are specifically for _**circles only**_. 

```text
minSize: ([shapeType, props]: [string, any]) => {
    const limit = 20;
    return sub(constOf(limit), props.r.contents);
}
```

insert description

```text
maxSize: ([shapeType, props]: [string, any]) => {
    const limit = Math.max(...canvasSize);
    return sub(props.r.contents, constOf(limit / 6.0));
}
```

insert description
