# Summary

Congratulation! You've completed all the tutorials that equip you to become a Penrose user, developer, domain expert, etc. 

We've come a long way from not knowing what makes a Penrose program to being a Penrose developer. Here's a quick run down of some of what we learned:

* Style, Substance, and Domain files make up a Penrose diagram.
* We define a type of object in our domain. We define the substances in our diagram by declaring its type and its variable name. We define the styles using the syntax `forall TYPE_NAME x {}`.
* We use the keyword `predicate` to define relationship between objects, the keyword `ensure` to define constraints on the diagram, and the keyword `function` to declare a function. 
* The principals of styling in Penrose is we start by defining styles for base objects, cascade styles, and override if needed with the keyword `override`.
* The visual meaning is in the style program, including all the concrete numerical things. Substance program is infinitely flexible. Nothing is built-in. Define your world in the domain file. Domain program is infinitely flexible. Nothing is built-in.
* Penrose implements constraints & objectives with energy functions in order to optimize diagrams. 

We hope you've had a fun time going through the tutorials and exercises, and perhaps see diagramming differently. 

For further explorations, here are some resources:

* More examples on complex diagrams: [LINK](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/wiki/Example-diagrams)
* How the Style compiler works: [LINK](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/wiki/How-the-Style-compiler-works)
* How to troubleshoot: [LINK](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/wiki/Troubleshooting)
* Check out the Penrose inspector for debugging \(some features like mod and drag are experimental at the moment\).

Have fun diagramming, and we will see you at future tutorials!
