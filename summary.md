# Summary

Congratulation! You've completed all the tutorials that equip you to become a Penrose user, developer, domain expert, etc. 

We've come a long way from not knowing what makes a Penrose program to being a Penrose developer. We've learned about the basics of Penrose, what are predicates and constraints, how to write functions, and how to write our own constraints and objectives that we can use in diagrams.

We hope you've had a fun time going through the tutorials and exercises, and perhaps see diagramming differently. 

For further explorations, here are some resources:

* More examples on complex diagrams: [LINK](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/wiki/Example-diagrams)
* How the Style compiler works: [LINK](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/wiki/How-the-Style-compiler-works)
* How to troubleshoot: [LINK](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/wiki/Troubleshooting)

Have fun diagramming, and we will see you at future tutorials!
